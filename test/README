Compile all code by:

make

Requires an installation of root 5.32 compiled with libminuit and a few other things that will be
detailed later


The following executables are then located in the bin/ directory:

reprocess:  Generates a set of files used by all the other applications, performs the following operations:
	- apply optional cuts on the input variables
	- apply optional reweighting
	- merge all backgrounds in to bkg.dat, signal to sig.dat and data to data.dat
	
geninput: generates histograms used to calculate likelihoods and p.d.f.s.  Input is the three 
	files (bkg.dat, sig.dat, data.dat) generated by rerocess.cc

validataion_plots: runs several sanity checks on the likelihood using pseudo-data

data_likelihood: produces likelihood function of the dataset


Sourcecode for the above apps is in the test/ directory along with the file 'samples.h'
which contains many variable definitions used by all the applications.
